# 2D arrays, images, optimization

Here we use a 2D array to look at the search for the best (least-squares) line for a simple regression.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

We return again to the income and prestige data from Duncan
{cite}`duncan1961socioeconomic`.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('data/Duncan_Occupational_Prestige.csv')
# Select the first 15 rows (occupations).
top_15 = df.head(15)
top_15
```

We will be doing a regression predicting `'prestige'` as a function of `'income'`.

```{python}
x = top_15['income']
y = top_15['prestige']
```

Plot these observations.

```{python}
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.xlabel('Income')
plt.ylabel('Prestige')
```

Start with a guess for the slope and intercept of a line to predict the
y (`'prestige'`) values from the x (`'income'`) values.

```{python}
b = 0.7  # Guessed slope.
c = 30  # Guessed intercept.
```

To find the best least-squares slope, we first need a function to calculate the
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for a given slope and intercept, and given x and
y vectors.

We've chosen RMSE as the cost (or loss) function here, but we could equally
have chosen the sum of squared errors (SSE) or the mean squared error (MSE);
these measures go up and down together, so when we have found the slope and
intercept minimizing the RMSE, that same slope and intercept will minimize SSE and MSE.

```{python}
def rmse_for_b_and_c(b, c, x, y):
    """ Root mean squared error for slope `b` intercept `c`
    """
    y_hat = b * x + c
    e = y - y_hat
    e2 = e ** 2
    return np.sqrt(np.mean(e2))
```

We calculate the RMSE for our guessed slope and intercept:

```{python}
rmse_for_b_and_c(b, c, x, y)
```

Just to make sure, we calculated the RMSE again, outside the function, to make sure we're returning the correct result:

```{python}
y_hat = b * x + c
e = y - y_hat
np.sqrt(np.mean(e ** 2))
```

We are now going to do a *brute-force* search for the best RMSE slope an intercept.

A brute-force search is where we search a wide range of slope and intercept pairs and select the pair that gives the lowest RMSE.

Alternative methods are using `scipy.optimize.minimize` to select sensible
slopes and intercepts to try for us, or to use the mathematical short-cuts of
routines like `scipy.statistics.linregress`.  These last will work for our case
— looking for the slope, intercept minimizing the *squared error* (or RMSE in
our case), but we can't use them for other calculations of the error.

First we select some slopes to try, based on looking at the scatterplot above.

```{python}
# Make 250 slopes by taking equally spaced values starting at 0
# and ending at 0.5.
candidate_slopes = np.linspace(0, 0.5, 250)
candidate_slopes[:10]
```

```{python}
# Make 250 intercepts by taking equally spaced values starting at 40
# and ending at 70.
candidate_inters = np.linspace(40, 70, 250)
candidate_inters[:10]
```

These are the number of candidate slopes and intercepts.  In our case, the `np.linspace` calls above dictate these numbers will be 250.

```{python}
n_slopes = len(candidate_slopes)
n_inters = len(candidate_inters)
```

Make a two-dimensional array to store the RMSE values corresponding to each
slope / intercept pair.

```{python}
rmses = np.zeros([n_slopes, n_inters])
rmses.shape
```

We are next going to start using Python's `range` to make sequences of integer values in our `for` loops.

Up until now, we have been using Numpys `arange` to make sequential arrays of numbers, and feeding these into our `for` loops:

```{python}
np.arange(1, 11)
```

```{python}
# The old way
for i in np.arange(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

Now we are going to switch to the more common Python idiom of using `range` in our `for` loops, instead of `np.arange`.  `range` takes the same arguments as does `np.arange` — start, stop and step — but returns a `range` object.

```{python}
my_r = range(1, 11)
my_r
```

```{python}
type(my_r)
```

```{python}
len(my_r)
```

`my_r` here is an object that refers to the sequence of numbers 1, 2, ... 10
— but does not directly contain this sequence.

We can force the `range` object to create and return the corresponding numbers
using e.g. `list`.  `list` asks the `range` object for it's sequence, and
`range` returns them one by one, from which `list` compiles the list.


```{python}
list(my_r)
```

We will use `range` in place of `np.arange` as the right-hand-side of `for` loops — providing the sequence from which we will fill the *loop variable*.  In the next cell, the loop variable is `v`:

```{python}
for v in range(5):
    print(v)
```

Back to the problem.  We loop through each slope in turn.  For each slope value we loop through each intercept value in turn.  For the given slope and intercept, we calculate the RMSE value, and store it in corresponding location in the `rmses` array, where the row position comes from the position of the slope value, and the column position comes from the position of the intercept value.

```{python}
for slope_no in range(n_slopes):
    b = candidate_slopes[slope_no]  # Get the corresponding slope.
    for inter_no in range(n_inters):
        c = candidate_inters[inter_no]  # Get the corresponding intercept.
        rmse = rmse_for_b_and_c(b, c, x, y)  # Calculate RMSE.
        rmses[slope_no, inter_no] = rmse  # Store in rmses array.
```

If we `plt.imshow` the `rmses` array, we see a dark valley corresponding to low
values of RMSE for the corresponding slope, intercept pairs.  Bright areas are
for much higher RMSEs.

```{python}
plt.imshow(rmses, cmap='gray')
plt.ylabel('Index for slopes')
plt.xlabel('Index for intercepts')
```

Next we want to find the slope and intercept corresponding to the minimum RMSE value we found in the `rmses` array.

To do this, we are going to need `np.where`.  It can tell us the location of values in terms of index position.

Consider a one-dimensional array like this:

```{python}
an_arr = np.array([1, 32, 99, 4, 2])
an_arr
```

We can make a Boolean array with True where the values are equal to 99, and False otherwise:

```{python}
an_arr == 99
```

`np.where` calculates *where* the True value(s) are, in terms of index position.  In our case, the 99 value is at position (index) 3 in the array:

```{python}
np.where(an_arr == 99)
```

We can apply the same logic to two-dimensions.

First we find the minimum RMSE value over the whole array:

```{python}
min_rmse = np.min(rmses)
min_rmse
```

Next we calculate a 2D Boolean array, of the same shape as `rmses`, but having True in the element corresponding the minimum value, and False otherwise.

```{python}
is_min = rmses == min_rmse
is_min[:10, :10]
```

Again, `plt.imshow` will show us the single True value as a white dot.  All the other values in this array are black (False).

```{python}
plt.imshow(is_min, cmap='gray', interpolation=None)
```

Back to `np.where`.  If we call this on the `is_min` 2D Boolean array, it
returns the row and column indices of the single True value in the array.
Notice the use of *unpacking* to unpack the two returned arrays (row
coordinates and column coordinates).

```{python}
min_row, min_col = np.where(is_min)
min_row, min_col
```

Now we know the row position of the minimum, we can work back to the corresponding slope value:

```{python}
best_slope = candidate_slopes[min_row]
best_slope
```

Similarly, for the corresponding intercept value:

```{python}
best_inter = candidate_inters[min_col]
best_inter
```

Let's run the mathematical calculation to find the best slope and intercept.

```{python}
import scipy.stats as sps
```

```{python}
res = sps.linregress(x, y)
res
```

Notice that the mathematical (Scipy) calculation differs slightly from our brute-force search values.  This is because our brute-force search didn't try every possible slope and intercept value, only the values we got from our `np.linspace` calls above.

As we'd expect though, the RMSE from the Scipy's high-precision estimate is a tiny-bit lower than our low-precision `np.linspace` estimate:

```{python}
rmse_for_b_and_c(best_slope, best_inter, x, y)
```

```{python}
rmse_for_b_and_c(res.slope, res.intercept, x, y)
```
